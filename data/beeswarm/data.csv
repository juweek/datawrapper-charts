@steelpanther9568,0,"Bournville is a model village on the southwest side of Birmingham, England, founded by the Quaker Cadbury family for employees at its Cadbury's factory and designed to be a ""garden"" (or ""model"") village  where the sale of alcohol was forbidden.

Cadbury's is well known for chocolate products ‚Äì including a dark chocolate bar branded Bournville.

Historically in northern Worcestershire, it is also a ward within the council constituency of Selly Oak and home to the Bournville Centre for Visual Arts.

Bournville is known as one of the most desirable areas to live in the UK; research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2003 found that it was ""one of the nicest places to live in Britain"".


History

Originally the area that was to become Bournville consisted of a few scattered farmsteads and cottages, linked by winding country lanes, with the only visual highlight being Bournbrook Hall, which was built during the Georgian era.

The bluebell glades of Stock Wood were said to be a relic of the Forest of Arden and there are Roman remains nearby.

Though Selly Manor and Minworth Greaves date back to the 14th century or earlier, they were each moved to Bournville in the 20th century, and are operated as a museum.


Cadbury

Having taken over their father John Cadbury's expanding business in 1861, the Quakers George and Richard Cadbury needed to move their cocoa and chocolate factory from Bridge Street in central Birmingham to a greenfield site to allow for expansion.

Cadbury were reliant on the canals for milk delivery, and on the railways for cocoa deliveries from the ports of London and Southampton.

They therefore needed a site which was undeveloped and had easy access to both canal and rail.

The brothers noticed the proposed development of the Birmingham West Suburban Railway, which would extend from central Birmingham south along the path of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal into the then green fields of southern Birmingham and the villages of northern Worcestershire.

In 1879, they moved their business to Bournbrook Hall, 4 miles (6.4 km) to the south of Birmingham.

The location was chosen as it was regarded as cleaner, healthier and more amenable to longer-term expansion plans.

Although rural, it was also already serviced by the new Stirchley Street railway station, which itself was located right next to the canal.

The Cadburys named the area 'Bournville' after a local river named The Bourn (not to be confused with Bourn Brook, a similarly named local river for which the neighbourhood of Bournbrook is named); with 'ville' being French for 'town'; this set Bournville apart from the local area.

Then the Cadburys began to develop their factory in the new suburb.

Loyal and hard-working workers were treated with great respect and relatively high wages and good working conditions; Cadbury also pioneered pension schemes, joint works committees and a full staff medical service.

In 1893, George Cadbury bought 120 acres (0.5 km2) of land close to the works and planned, at his own expense, a model village which would ""alleviate the evils of modern, more cramped living conditions"".

By 1900, the estate included 313 cottages and houses set on 330 acres (1.3 km2) of land, and many more similar properties were built in the years leading up to the First World War, with smaller developments taking place later on in the 20th century.

These almost 'Arts and Crafts' houses were traditional in design but with large gardens and modern interiors, and were designed by the resident architect William Alexander Harvey.

These designs became a blueprint for many other model village estates around Britain.

It is also noteworthy that, because George Cadbury was a temperance Quaker, no public houses have ever been built in Bournville; however, since the late 1940s, there has been a licensed members' bar at Rowheath Pavilion.

The Cadburys were particularly concerned with the health and fitness of their British workforce, incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans and encouraging swimming, walking and indeed all forms of outdoor sports.

In the early 1920s, extensive open lands were purchased at Rowheath and laid to football and hockey pitches together with a grassed running track.

Rowheath Pavilion was designed and built in accordance with the instructions of George Cadbury and opened in July 1924.

At that time, it served as the clubhouse and changing rooms for the acres of sports playing fields, several bowling greens, a fishing lake and an outdoor swimming lido, a natural mineral spring forming the source for the lido's healthy waters.

The Rowheath Pavilion itself, which still exists, was used for balls and dinners and the whole area was specifically for the benefit of the Cadbury workers and their families with no charges for the use of any of the sporting facilities by Cadbury employees or their families.

The lido was eventually closed in the 1970s after complaints of noise disturbance were made by residents of the newly built Oak Farm estate, coupled with new and stringent health and safety regulations relating to outdoor public swimming facilities.

Cadbury's also built the Bournville indoor swimming baths on Bournville Lane (separate buildings for 'girls' and men), the Valley pool boating lake and the picturesque cricket pitch adjacent to the factory site, that was made famous as the picture on boxes of Milk Tray chocolates throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.

In 1900, the Bournville Village Trust was set up to formally control the development of the estate, independently of George Cadbury or the Cadbury company.

Elizabeth Cadbury succeeded her husband as chair of the Bournville Village Trust in 1922.

The trust focused on providing schools, hospitals, museums, public baths and reading rooms.

As Bournville is a conservation area, another job of the Bournville Village Trust is to accept or reject plans for building extension and modification.

An almost campus feel evolved, with a triangular village green, infant and junior schools, the School of Art and the Day Continuation School (originally intended for young Cadbury employees) and a host of events such as f√™tes and Maypole dances.

The carillon and a Quaker meeting house are also beside the village green.

The trust continues to exercise an international influence on housing and town planning generally.

Now containing 7,800 homes on 1,000 acres (4 km2) of land with 100 acres (0.4 km2) of parks and open spaces, Bournville remains a popular residential area of Birmingham.

Cadbury is still one of Birmingham's main employers, and continues to make chocolate products.

The dark chocolate Bournville Plain is now manufactured in France and sold in the UK.

Cadbury also named their brand of malted drinks Bournvita after Bournville.

Cadbury World is now established here.

@marine6680,0,"Speak for yourself with that whole ‚Äútastes fine to us Americans‚Äù thing‚Ä¶ I dislike most mass produced American chocolate. Some smaller specialty brands do a good job though. Even the national premium brands like Godiva are at best equivalent to mass market brands in Europe.

Often foreign chocolate is vastly superior, various European chocolate and stuff from Japan. In fact most candy and sweets from outside the US is superior to American sweets.

@syxepop,0,"About ""Uncle Milty""...  Obviously Cheddar has THE WRONG VERSION (2:19) of his story. Milton Hershey went to Europe on a several month vacation tour (he was already making caramel as The Lancaster Caramel Co. by then) and found ou19t about a CHOCOLATE BAR MAKING MACHINE already developed in Switzerland years earlier. 

Since nobody else had anything like it Stateside he decided to buy and import one of those machines for his factory. When he came back to Pennsylvania he and his people developed (after quite a lot of failed formulas) THE HERSHEY MILK CHOCOLATE BAR in 1896 as the first US-made chocolate bar.

His chocolate sold so much he decided to sell his caramel business to go full force into it.

Hershey didn't invent the chocolate bar as it was already invented in Europe.

Another thing... Cheddar forgets to even mention Uncle Milty's real competitor (and partner for years) Forrest Mars, of M&M's fame. When Mars found in Spain during their Civil War in the later 1930's some particular ""chocolate buttons"" that didn't melt in the sun. Brought those Stateside and covered them with a candy coating. 

But when WWII started sugar and chocolate were rationed in US and both Hershey and Mars got US War Department contracts for putting chocolate foods into rations, so they made an agreement for Hershey to provide Mars with chocolate so neither supplies of both companies would be cut off. M&M's and other Mars confectionery products used Hershey's chocolate until like the 1960's.",2021-09-18T04:10:58Z,2021-09-18T04:29:10Z,none,,686,249,uncle milty obviously cheddar wrong version story milton hershey went europe several month vacation tour already making caramel lancaster caramel co found ou chocolate bar making machine already developed switzerland year earlier nobody else anything stateside decided buy import one machine factory came back pennsylvania people developed quite lot failed formula hershey milk chocolate bar first u made chocolate bar chocolate sold much decided sell caramel business go full force hershey invent chocolate bar already invented europe thing cheddar forgets even mention uncle milty real competitor partner year forrest mar fame mar found spain civil war later particular chocolate button melt sun brought stateside covered candy coating wwii started sugar chocolate rationed u hershey mar got u war department contract putting chocolate food ration made agreement hershey provide mar chocolate supply company would cut mar confectionery product used hershey chocolate,2,5,0,0.016111111111111107,-0.5992

@topeuph,9,"I came over to the states from Wales  a few years ago, and fancied a nice bar of chocolate, so went down to the hotel shop and bought a standard bar of Hershey's. What could possibly go wrong? I'd heard of Hershey's from TV although at the time it wasn't sold where I lived. Well, I'm sure you know the feeling when you bite into something and it's not the taste you were expecting! My eyes widened and my mouth went into gag mode! I forced the first bite down eventually, but my brain refused to believe what had just happened, I assumed my taste buds hadn't woken up or something as there is no way a chocolate bar should taste the way I'd just imagined! so I took another bite, and holy shit! This chocolate really does taste of puke. I had lots of fun offering a chunk of Hershey's to my friends who were with me on the trip, just to see their reaction! We assumed that my bar was part of a dodgy batch. I know this post reads like I'm dissing American chocolate, ok I am a bit üòÇ, but if that is the taste you're used to then you obviously won't get the viseral reaction I had.

My go to chocolate has always been Hershey's Special Dark, and in recent years it was Hershey's Special Dark Nuggets with almonds. Mmm, chocolate heaven, but starting in the past year or two, we started getting them with stale or even rancid almonds (had to spit them out and rinse or eat something else to get rid of the taste), so I bought a bag of plain Special Dark, and that's when I noticed the chocolate had changed for the worse.

In Sweden and Norway we have what in Sweden is called Marabou and in Norway Freia. The original is Freia, which owner 1916 started a new wing of Freia in Sweden, called it Marabou, and started making chocolate by the same recipies as in Norway.
Nowadays they work as different companies.

Marabou mj√∂lkchoklad (Marabou milkchocolate) is the leading product in Sweden, but there're many, many different kinds in different ways, from ""old fashion"" chocolate bars to assorted chocolate creames. The Aladdin chocolate box is a must in Swedish homes during Christmas.
I believe the Daim bar is sold in many countries.

In the early eighties I spend some time in the USA, grooming harness horses, together with many more Swedes. Occasionly we had presents sent from Sweden, containing Marabou chocolate and Swedish coffee. When those packages arrived we had a lot of American friends üòÇüòÇüòÇ, though they prefered the Swedish both chocolate and coffee.

Apparently, Hershey‚Äôs have rights to produce Cadbury products in the US, but with a different recipe, so Cadbury chocolates UK/Europe can‚Äôt sell to the US market.

Which might be because before the pandemic people living near the border would just pass from one country to another whenever, just for some basic shopping.

I don't understand why people still like to eat pickled, soured, salted and smoked stuff. Those are all very unhealthy methods of preservation and were used when we had no freezers or fast transportation. These days frozen fruits or vegetables are no worse, or even better, than fresh. Fish can be frozen very successfully too, as can just about anything else. Very few things are truly ruined by freezing. Chocolate can be kept in a refrigerator, which works very well to keep it fresh for a long time. Nothing should be altered chemically for the purposes of preservation. Make stuff closer to home. Give your business to local chocolate shops. Yeah, it's a bit more expensive. SO DON'T EAT SO MUCH OF IT. It should be a rare treat. Why SHOULD chocolate be treated any differently than a rare treat. If you can afford it then eat it often, if not, eat it rarely. You'll only be healthier for it. Nothing wrong with wealthy people affording more expensive fancier stuff.

@Cythil,0,"I would say it more than just that. But is also depending on what Chocolate late you used to. Like high sugar? Yeah. That is something I dislike about American Chocolate. But is also a very common problem with a lot, if not most European chocolates. And I find that to be more of an issue. But I think that is depended on local tastes. Germans for me like food to be almost sickly sweet compared to what I am used to for example.

I am sure a lot of people do not mind if it is a bit bitter. Very dark chocolate tend to be a bit bitter and some see this even as a high quality and you're having a refined taste. Though I am not so keen on bitter Chocolate and find that you can get dark Chocolate that is not that bitter (I like when it paired with something fruity in taste to then.)

And of course quality plays a role. So while there might be some minor differences between cheap American Chocolate and cheap European Chocolate, they will likely both taste pretty bad compared to high quality Chocolate.",2021-05-04T22:06:18Z,2021-05-04T22:06:18Z,none,,2253,193,would say also depending chocolate late used high sugar yeah something dislike american chocolate also common problem lot european chocolate find issue think depended local taste german food almost sickly sweet compared used example sure lot people mind bit bitter dark chocolate tend bit bitter see even high quality refined taste keen bitter chocolate find get dark chocolate bitter paired something fruity taste course quality play role might minor difference cheap american chocolate cheap european chocolate likely taste pretty bad compared high quality chocolate,0,6,6,0.035,-0.7596

Not only was it so different to real chocolate, it may as well have been in a completely deferent food group, but the texture was also off; furry instead of silky. It was like eating the contents of a vacuum bag, leaving me genuinely perplexed as to why America, I land known for its food excess, would tolerate something so bland and nasty... and unlike actual chocolate! I see that they just were never really given a choice. To this end though, I've also seen Americans eat European chocolate and say it's too sweet. Guess it's down to what one is used to. Since then I have seen Hershey's for sale in the UK. It always seems to be on discount offer. I would never buy it or know anyone that would. Yuk; brown furry curdled cheese... you can keep it America!",2021-04-30T17:06:40Z,2021-04-30T17:06:40Z,none,,2844,209,interesting often wondered european always known hershey tv film naturally looked forward trying first time friend bought back u wondered big brand never broken european market first horrible bite answer different real chocolate may well completely deferent food group texture also furry instead silky eating content vacuum bag leaving genuinely perplexed america land known food excess would tolerate something bland nasty actual chocolate see never really given choice end also seen american eat european chocolate say sweet guess one used seen hershey sale uk always seems discount offer would never buy know anyone would yuk brown furry curdled cheese keep america,5,1,6,0.0012731481481481448,0.8537

@evanharrison4054,0,"I called bullcrap on this about a decade ago and asked someone who went to the US to bring me some chocolate of the better kind.
I ate all of it from Hershey's, Almond Joy, Mounds and Reese's, and all I can say is that I would rather chew drywall or cardboard. It's absolutely awful. I sadly failed to put my hands on a butterfinger or a whatchamacallit, but I'm just going to assume they aren't so good either. 

I did the same with cheese, fruit, beer and jerky as well, and my conclusion as a man of refined tastes is that American chocolate is garbage, American cheese is not even cheese, American fruit is basically water with texture, American beer is what I imagine my piss tastes like after having drunk actual beer, and American jerky is amazing and I'm still trying to recreate it after a decade. Never could get that meaty, spicy, orange-y taste just right. I just know it probably has something to do with anise. 

Anyway, my conclusion is that Europeans(that's not a thing by the way. There's no such thing as an ""european man"") hate American chocolate because we managed to retain our tastebuds. 
I try my best to be objective, but there's no way anyone would ever prefer american chocolate to the real thing.",2021-04-30T11:30:28Z,2021-04-30T11:30:28Z,none,,2859,221,called bullcrap decade ago asked someone went u bring chocolate better kind ate hershey almond joy reese say would rather chew drywall cardboard absolutely awful sadly failed put hand butterfinger whatchamacallit going assume good cheese fruit beer jerky well conclusion man refined taste american chocolate garbage american cheese even cheese american fruit basically water texture american beer imagine piss taste drunk actual beer american jerky amazing still trying recreate decade never could get meaty spicy orange taste right know probably something anise anyway conclusion european thing way thing european man hate american chocolate managed retain tastebud try best objective way anyone would ever prefer american chocolate real thing,4,2,0,0.07857142857142857,-0.5204

I have sent boxes of candy across the ocean to friends in the US i've met through gaming, and they've sent me boxes back, and with the 30 or so different people i've had try Norwegian chocolate, the one thing they all have in common is sentences like ""omg! we don't have anything like this, this is amazing"" and usually want information on how to order it.

Even had a couple get annoyed after the fact that because they said [US] chocolate didn't fulfill cravings anymore because all they can think about is Norwegian chocolate. 

Though personally i think Belgian milk chocolate has us beat by a mile.

If anyone's curious and/or want to order and try some themselves, usually isn't too hard to find, the most popular ones were ""Freia melkesjokolade"" (Freia is the brand) ""Freia M"" and the biggest favorite is ""Nidar Smash"" though that ones more of a mix between chocolate and corn chips, so just google any of those if you're curious",2021-04-22T00:58:31Z,2021-04-22T00:58:31Z,none,,3491,176,experience simply chocolate better sent box candy ocean friend u met gaming sent box back different people try norwegian chocolate one thing common sentence omg anything amazing usually want information order even couple get annoyed fact said u chocolate fulfill craving anymore think norwegian chocolate personally think belgian milk chocolate u beat anyone curious want order try usually hard find popular one freia melkesjokolade freia brand freia biggest favorite nidar smash one mix chocolate corn chip google curious,0,1,8,0.07543859649122805,0.9582

@paul756uk2,0,"Cadburys isn't a good example for comparing European chocolate to American. For starters it's American owned and is only available widely in the UK. It's not a particularly good quality chocolate as it has a fairly low cocoa content and uses vegetable fat as opposed to cocoa butter in European chocolate. Most Swiss, German French and Italian chocolate to name a few are generally much higher quality. I would say a manufacturer such as lindt is a very good quality that is available throughout Europe. The Nestl√© chocolate manufactured in Europe is also a good quality. Toblerone is ok but owned by Kraft, the same as cadburys. Personally I like Aldi chocolate.

I love the candy here but miss the candy in America so I order it online. I think the reason for the taste difference is because there are a lot of ingredients that are allowed in America that are banned in Europe. Like high fructose corn syrup that you Americans use in soda instead of sugar. Here in Europe, all soda is made with sugar and not GMO produced high fructose corn syrup. The other thing that's different in America is McDonald's. Here in Norway McDonald's french fries are made with 3 ingredients and 3 ingredients only. That being, potatoes, oil, and salt when in America McDonald's french fries are made with the same ingredients but with 50+ other additives that don't need to be in them. Because if you took American McDonald's french fries and left them out for 2 years they would look the same as when you bought them. Unlike here in Norway the same fries would have grown mold after 7 days. Me personally, would never like to eat something that doesn't grow mold after a while.

Cadbury is very popular in the UK, but it's also very sweet, and a little greasy, with an overpowering vanilla taste: it's still enjoyable, but while there's an arguement for it being a leader in the UK, it seems odd to use it as a benchmark for European Chocolate.

@EtherealBlueRainbow,1,"I can't stand Us choco. Cadbury tastes horrible too, a harsh, overly sweet, with sour/bitter undertones, which explains why I wouldn't I wouldn't buy Milka products for the longest time, just because both are purple & I mixed up the 2. Although I have learned from the comments that both are owned by the same company, Milka actually has a European chocolate taste, soft, mellow & buttery, they are the biggest sellers on the market because they have a middle ground taste that works for teenagers & adults. To compare to other brands well known in Europe: 
Kinder, geared for kids, goes heavier on the sugar, while Ferrero & Raffaello, same company but marketed to adults, try to strike the perfect balance with the nuts or coco, & everyone knows Nutella;
Lindt: what I call indulgence chocolat, extra soft & creamy;
Mars, Twix, Toblerone, etc: the too sweet, but still tasty in half/quarter doses, from time to time, & a lot better tasting in ice cream;
The store brand: the cheapest, watered down, but still decent tasting option for lighter wallets;
Then you have to add all the specialized chocolate brands, like Jeff de Bruges, more expensive, but also more refined & with more variety, they usually have their own small shops.
Edit: Adding Ritter Sport, mostly unknown in France, but decent basic chocolat.",2021-04-18T20:34:53Z,2021-04-18T20:45:03Z,none,,3750,224,stand u choco cadbury taste horrible harsh overly sweet sour bitter undertone explains buy milka product longest time purple mixed learned comment owned company milka actually european chocolate taste soft mellow buttery biggest seller market middle ground taste work teenager adult compare brand well known europe kinder geared kid go heavier sugar ferrero raffaello company marketed adult try strike perfect balance nut coco everyone know nutella lindt call indulgence chocolat extra soft creamy mar twix toblerone etc sweet still tasty half quarter dos time time lot better tasting ice cream store brand cheapest watered still decent tasting option lighter wallet add specialized chocolate brand jeff bruges expensive also refined variety usually small shop edit adding ritter sport mostly unknown france decent basic chocolat,8,3,6,0.08045634920634921,0.9313

@grimmbartrides,0,"Huh. Gotta admit I was never really able to pin down _why_ I (being from Germany) have always felt that American chocolate is terrible. So this might be part of the reason, but it's definitely not the whole story. In addition, US chocolate in general and Hershey's in particular feels like a shovelful of mud in your mouth, compared to European chocolate. It's so coarse and sandy. Some Euro choc is too smooth and mushy (like Lindt) but if I had to blind-test this US stuff, I'd probably have guessed it's some Soviet ersatz product from communist economy of scarcity.

That said, some of the very best chocolate I know is the Swedish brand Marabou. It's the ideal ""lagom"" choklad - just the right sweetness, cocoa-ness, aroma, ""snap"" and smoothness. It's part of Mondelez now but the taste still is the real thing. :)",2021-04-14T20:49:36Z,2021-04-14T20:49:36Z,none,,3986,144,huh gotta admit never really able pin _why_ germany always felt american chocolate terrible might part reason definitely whole story addition u chocolate general hershey particular feel shovelful mud mouth compared european chocolate coarse sandy euro choc smooth mushy lindt test u stuff probably guessed soviet ersatz product communist economy scarcity said best chocolate know swedish brand marabou ideal lagom choklad right sweetness cocoa ness aroma snap smoothness part mondelez taste still real thing,0,1,0,0.1435515873015873,0.9804

@The157ra,0,"Thanks for clearing up this mystery for me. I've been wondering why Hershey was so bad since I first tried it during the great marketing disaster of several decades ago, when Hershey tried to take Australia by storm and cost them a small fortune. Back then, most of the chocolate wound up being sold off at ridiculously low prices to unwary customers at the Reject Shop chain.

A correction though - Hershey chocolate doesn't taste like vomit. It tastes just fine while one eats it, but one is then left mystified by the vomit-like aftertaste that follows.

Fortunately, the Hershey chocolate now sold in Australia comes without the vomit aftertaste and makes for a pleasant change to the more typical European type chocolates sold here.

@karelkootjes4019,0,"Hardly ever seen cadburry or hershes here in the netherlands.
-> as it is imported it is quite expensive, while it is utter trash.
**I'll pick gladly any verkade, milka, or dutch store brand bar over hershes.

Dutch and Belgium chocolate laws were MUCH more strick than eu laws.
as such most what usa sells as chocolate, would to my childhood be ""cocao-fantasy"" the legal forced name for any ""chocolaty product"" that does not fit those requirements.

The original dutch/belgium standards were quite tough, originally it was something like :
with white chocolate the minimum must be 60% of coca parts (all cocoa fat)
with milk chocolate the minimum 65%, and a minimum of 15% milkpowder
and with pure chocolate it must be at least 80% (all cococa powder)
**and all fat in them must be cocao fat.
=> proper high quality belgium and dutch chocolate usually still adhers to these old standards.

sadly the eu uniformity indeed has lowered the bar considerably for us dutch and we now have to check lables more to get what WE consider chocolate instead of ""cacao fantasy"" labled as chocolate because the eu allows it so.

add to that generally usa chocolate contains WAY more sugar than I like in my chocolate.

I prefer mostly white or pure chocolate, milk less so btw.

For pure, I generally look for something with 85% or more cocao powder, and no sugar whatsoever.
for white, I prefer anything with 60% cocao fat and 6% sugar or less, and milkpowder for the rest and less or no other ingredients.
-> if possible I prefer sunflowerlechtine over soylechticine for emulgator.. but thats hard to find these days so thats the one compromise I do usually have to make.

for pure chocolate, there are plenty of 90%+ cocao bars in our stores.. I usually take the 94 or 96% one.. if they have it (98% sometimes also on shelves) the brand Lindt has those very high cocoa content bars.

for white chocolate.. the easiest to go to callebrau... they sell 3 types of white chocolate.. one is only 36% cocoa fat, one is 60% cocoa fat (the one I pick) and the last one is I believe 42% with a bit or caramelisation of the milk in it going on.",2021-04-01T16:21:05Z,2021-04-01T16:27:18Z,none,,5072,381,hardly ever seen cadburry hershes netherlands imported quite expensive utter trash pick gladly verkade milka dutch store brand bar hershes dutch belgium chocolate law much strick eu law usa sell chocolate would childhood cocao fantasy legal forced name chocolaty product fit requirement original dutch belgium standard quite tough originally something white chocolate minimum must coca part cocoa fat milk chocolate minimum minimum milkpowder pure chocolate must least cococa powder fat must cocao fat proper high quality belgium dutch chocolate usually still adhers old standard sadly eu uniformity indeed lowered bar considerably u dutch check lables get consider chocolate instead cacao fantasy labled chocolate eu allows add generally usa chocolate contains way sugar chocolate prefer mostly white pure chocolate milk le btw pure generally look something cocao powder sugar white prefer anything cocao fat sugar le milkpowder rest le ingredient possible prefer sunflowerlechtine soylechticine emulgator thats hard find day thats one compromise usually make pure chocolate plenty cocao bar store usually take one sometimes also shelf brand lindt high cocoa content bar white chocolate easiest go callebrau sell type white chocolate one cocoa fat one cocoa fat one pick last one believe bit caramelisation milk going,7,1,6,0.03367601410934743,0.226
